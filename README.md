AWS Cloud Support Simulation 🛠️☁️
License: MIT  Tech Stack: AWS, Python, Terraform
📌 Overview
This repository is a hands‑on AWS Cloud Support lab built to mirror the daily challenges faced by Cloud Support Engineers, CloudOps specialists, and Technical Support Engineers.
Instead of polished tutorials, environments here are intentionally broken to simulate real incidents. Each scenario forces you to diagnose root causes, apply fixes, and document solutions — exactly the instincts hiring managers look for in cloud support roles.

🚀 Purpose
- Showcase practical troubleshooting skills in AWS.
- Provide reproducible scenarios for learners and job seekers.
- Build a portfolio of real support cases to land remote, felon‑friendly cloud support opportunities.

🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- AWS Services: EC2, VPC, Security Groups, S3, Lambda, GuardDuty, IAM, CloudFormation, CloudWatch
- Networking & Security: VPC design, routing issues, subnet configs, NACLs, least‑privilege IAM policies
- Automation: Python + Boto3 scripts for monitoring, detection, remediation
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform & CloudFormation deployments
- DevOps Practices: Git workflows, version control, systematic troubleshooting, documentation
- Problem Solving: Root‑cause analysis, security misconfigurations, connectivity failures
